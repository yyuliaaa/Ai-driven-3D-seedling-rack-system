# CONTRIBUTING

# Git / Github

If you would like to contribute to pycatia there are a number of ways you can do
this.

If your contribution is to the codebase you should learn the basics of git and
github and how to create a fork of pycatia and then a new branch for your
specific pull request and creating the pull request itself.

With your pull request please also submit a small section of code that
demonstrates how to use the class method you have added / fixed.

# Which branch should I work on?

The master branch represents the latest released version of pycatia. Any pull
requests against the pycatia application itself shall not be done to this branch
but the `developement` branch.

However, changes to the documentation or examples can be done against either.

## Adding new modules

I have now added all the modules I was able to extract from the documentation so
there shouldn't be a need to add new modules as of 0.6.0.

## Examples / User Scripts

New scripts / examples are always welcome as they great for new users to learn
how to use pycatia.

Please refer to the existing examples and user_scripts for how to format your
code.

If you would like to submit a script / example you can raise an issue or pull
request on github. Alternatively you can email them to me at evereux@gmail.com.

### Examples

Examples should be kept simple and if possible focus on showing how to use a
single method.

### User Scripts

These are more advanced scripts that don't fall under the category of examples.
The aim is to provide example scripts that could be useful for end users of
pycatia.

## Tests

There is a test framework in place that covers the basic set of pycatia
features. However, there is a lot of work to do here in expanding on those.
Pull-requests expanding on these tests would be very much appreciated.
